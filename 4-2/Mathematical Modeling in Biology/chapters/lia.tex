\begin{defn}
    Let \(E(x,y)\) have continuous first partial derivatives at all points \((x,y)\) in a domain \(D\) containing the origin \((0,0)\).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The function \(E\) is called positive defined in \(D\) if \(E(0,0)=0\) and \(E(x,y)>0\) for all other points in \((x,y)\) in \(D\).
        \item The function \(E\) is called positive semi-defined in \(D\) if \(E(0,0)=0\) and \(E(x,y)\geq 0\) for all other points in \((x,y)\) in \(D\).
        \item The function \(E\) is called negative defined in \(D\) if \(E(0,0)=0\) and \(E(x,y)< 0\) for all other points in \((x,y)\) in \(D\).
        \item The function \(E\) is called negative semi-defined in \(D\) if \(E(0,0)=0\) and \(E(x,y)\leq 0\) for all other points in \((x,y)\) in \(D\).
    \end{enumerate}
