\chapter{Base for a Topology}
\begin{defn}
    Let \(\xt\) be a topological space. Then a class \(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \tau\) is a \textbf{base} for the topology \(\tau\) on \(X\) if every member of \(\tau\) can be written as a union of members of \(mathcal{B}\). Equivalently, \(U\in \tau\) can be written as \(U=\cup_{B\in\mathcal{B}}B\).
\end{defn}
