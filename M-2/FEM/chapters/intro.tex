\chapter{Approximation Solutions}
We will discuss the following methods,
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Galerkin Method
    \item Least Square Method
    \item Collocation Method
    \item ----
    \item Petrov-Galerkin Method
\end{enumerate}
The main idea behind all these methods are to minimize the error using different weight function.
\section{Galerkin Method}
\subsection{Method}
In this method 
\begin{enumerate}[label=Step (\roman*):]
    \item Assume a solution \(\bar{u}(x)\) as a polynomial such that the degree of polynomial is greater than the order of differential equation by at least one.
    \item Satisfy the boundary conditions to get values of two unknown coefficients.
    \item Differentiate the assumed solution \(\bar{u}(x)\) to satisfy the differential equation.
    \item Take error/residual as \(\varepsilon(x)\)
    \item Take weight function as  
\end{enumerate}
