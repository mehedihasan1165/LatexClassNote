\begin{prob}
    Construct deterministic finite set automata that recognize each of these languages:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item The set of bit strings that begin with two $ 0 $'s.
        \item The set of bit strings that contains two consecutive $ 0 $'s.
        \item The set of bit strings that do not contain two consecutive $ 0 $'s.
        \item The set of bit strings that end with two consecutive $ 0 $'s.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item We need to construct a deterministic finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that begins with two 0s. Besides the start state $ s_0 $, we include a nonfinal state $ s_1 $; we move to $ s_1 $ from $ s_0 $ if the first bit is a 0. Next, we add a final state $ s_2 $, which we move to from $ s_1 $ if the second bit is a 0. When we have reached $ s_1 $ we know that the first two input bits are both 0s, so we stay in the state $ s_2 $ no matter that the succeeding bits (if any) are. We move to a nonfinal state $ s_3 $ from $ s_0 $ if the first bit is a 1 and from $ s_1 $ if the second bit is a 1. The figure below represents the finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that begin with two 0s.\\

        \item We need to construct a deterministic finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that contain two consecutive 0s. Besides the start state $ s_0 $, we include a nonfinal state $ s_1 $, which tells us that the last input bit seen is a 0, but either the bit before it was a 1, or this bit was the initial bit of string. We include a final state $ s_2 $ that we move from $ s_1 $ when the next input bit after a 0 is also a 0. If a 1 follows a 0 in the string, we return to $ s_0 $ and begin looking for consecutive 0s all over again. The figure below represents the finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that contains two consecutive 0s.\\

        \item We need to construct a deterministic finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that do not contain two consecutive 0s. Besides the start state $ s_0 $, which should be a final state, we include a final state $ s_1 $, which we move to from $ s_0 $ when 0 is the first input bit. When an input bit is a 1, we return to, or stay in, state $ s_0 $. We add a state $ s_2 $, which we move to from $ s_1 $ when the input bit is a 0. Reaching $ s_2 $ tells us that we have seen two consecutive 0s as input bits. We stay in state $ s_2 $ once we have reached it; this state is not final. The figure below represents the finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that do not contain two consecutive 0s.\\

        \item We need to construct a deterministic finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that ends with two 0s. Besides the start state $ s_0 $, we include a nonfinal state $ s_1 $, which we move to if the first bit is 0. We include a final state $ s_2 $, which we move to from $ s_1 $ if the next input bit after a 0 is also a 0. If an input of 0 follows a previous 0, we stay in state $ s_2 $ because the last two input bits are still 0s. Once we are in state $ s_2 $, an input bit of 1 sends us back to $ s_0 $, and we begin looking for consecutive 0s all over again. We also return to $ s_0 $ if the next input is a 1 when are in state $ s_1 $. The figure below represents the finite-state automation that recognizes the set of bit strings that ends with two 0s.\\
