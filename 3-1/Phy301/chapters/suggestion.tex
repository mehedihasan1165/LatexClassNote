\section{Electromagnetism and Modern Physics}
Electromagnetism:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coulombs Law.
    \item Define point Charge, Conservation of Charge, Quantization of Charge [Proton and neutron are made of fractional electric charges, how charges remain quantized?]
    \item Electric field and a dipole in an electric field
    \[E=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{p}{x^3};\quad\vec{\tau}=-\vec{p}\times\vec{E};\quad U=-\vec{p}\cdot\vec{E}\]
    \item Gauss's Law and its applications; Gauss's Law $ \leftrightarrow $ Coulomb's Law
    \item Define Electric potential and Electric Potential energy, Potential due to point charge and dipole.
    \item Capacitance of different types of Capacitor. Energy $ U=1/2 CV^2 $ or $ U=1/2 \epsilon_0 E^2 $
    \item Effect of dielectric in capacitor
    \item Difference between electric field and magnetic field, Magnetic Force $ F=ILB $, $ F=qvB $
    \item Torque on a current loop, HALL effect and voltage
    \item Biot-Savart Law and applications
    \item Define Ampere and Ampere's Law, magnetic Flux
    \item Magnetic field for solenoid and toroid
    \item Brief idea on Faraday's Law, Lenz Law, Self and mutual inductance
    \item r.m.s value of $ I $ and $ E $, RLC circuit in AC circuit.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
Modern Physics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Photoelectric effect, Compton effect, de-Broglie wave, Find the expression of Phase velocity and group velocity
    \item Brief idea about Uncertainty principle, different types of atomic model, nuclear size, binding energy.
    \item Properties of $ \alpha,\, \beta,\,\gamma $; Radioactive decay law, decay constant, mean life, half-life, Application of Radioactivity, Radioactive dating - the age of earth calculation.
\end{itemize}
